We apologize: this page is still under construction.  The expected future content will provide and overview over current and past large development projects.  Each project is expected to show a description/specs and, for current projects, a progress report.

## Projects ##

From time to time, developers define large development efforts that are complex and/or large in scope and/or require developer cooperation for the project duration.  Theoretically, each project should have clear specifications, approved by the current Technical Advisors ("Gatekeepers") and should have mapped an overall path how the specifications will be translated into functionality.  This preparatory planning is imperative so that the project results end up suitable for being merged into the OpenAFS main branch upon completion.  Without such planning and approval by the Technical Advisors, the developer(s) run danger of investing much blood, sweat, and tears writing code that isn't compatible with the OpenAFS main branch and/or is not supportable there.  We cannot emphasize enough: it is IMPERATIVE to plan projects and get approval for them prior to actually beginning to write code! 

While this page is still under construction, you may wish to consult www.openafs.org for current or past development projects.
