## AFS and OpenAFS ##

AFS is a distributed filesystem product, pioneered at Carnegie Mellon University in cooperation with IBM in the mid 1980s, and subsequently supported and developed into a product by Transarc Corporation (now IBM Pittsburgh Labs). In November 2000, IBM released a version of the source code of the AFS product to the community for development and maintenance under the IBM Public License (IPL, a license approved by the Open Source Initiative). IBM called this release “OpenAFS”. The OpenAFS code is available to all individuals or organizations free of charge.
