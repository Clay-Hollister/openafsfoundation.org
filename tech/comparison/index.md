## Filesystem Comparison ##

Among the plethora of existing network file systems, OpenAFS is most like DFS (conceived at Microsoft) or NFS (originating at SUN Microsystems).

While various aspects of different file systems have been compared on occasion, we are unaware of a complete, side-by-side comparion, and we hope to be able to fulfil that request.  If you would like to assist in compiling a comprehensive comparison, please contact us; we very much will appreciate your active support in featuring such a useful overview!
