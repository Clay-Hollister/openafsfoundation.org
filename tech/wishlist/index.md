## Wishlist ##

This page is currently still under construction, we apologize.  The future page will show you known items somebody has requested that they be done, with specs for each item.  The purpose of those listings is that any developer wishing to contribute by claiming and completing a task but not knowing what work would be useful, can scan this list and, hopefully, find a suitable task for his/her skills and interests.  

When you claim an item, please let us know so that we can post your name and email as claimant, so that other developers wishing to assist and join you in your efforts can do so easily.

However you are able to contribute, and whichever item from the wish list you may be able to claim, we thank you in advance for your willingness to volunteer and to improve OpenAFS technology!
