### AFS3 Standardization Group ###

At present, our flagship initiative is the AFS3 Standardization Group.

The AFS3 Standardization Group defines network protocols and other standards related to the AFS3 protocol family. The AFS assigned numbers registry is used to track various protocol constants to promote interoperablity. The group operated under a Provisional Charter by community consensus since August 3, 2010. Their work is done primarily on the afs3-standardization mailing list. Participation is open to all interested parties.

The current chair is Jeffrey Hutzelman <jhutz@cmu.edu> who is expected to serve in this role until October 1, 2015.

On March 5, 2014, the Standardization Group announced the afs3-rxgk draft has been promoted to AFS3 experimental status. Heart-felt congratulations and thanks for this achievement.  You can learn more about their work and its progress on the Standardization Group's page.
    
    
    
At present, no other initiatives are under way.  If you would like to begin a new initiative, please let us know.
