## Support OpenAFS ##

If you wish to see OpenAFS grow and improve, there are a variety of ways you
can contribute resources to OpenAFS Foundation, which will use those resources
to improve or promote OpenAFS. However, note that the OpenAFS Foundation is
currently **not** a 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation, and donations to the
OpenAFS Foundation are **not** tax deductible. (See our [ABOUT
page]({{site.baseurl}}/about/) for more information about The Foundation's
legal status.)

### Donate Money###

The OpenAFS Foundation currently accepts monetary donations via PayPal. You do
not need to have/get a PayPal account in order to donate; just a credit card. Remember that even the smallest donation makes a lot of difference to an organization that has minimal operating funds.  The Foundation appreciates any amount you can give and thank you for your generosity.  Click the button below

### Donate Equipment ###

At times, OpenAFS utilizes donated machines to be re-used for building
OpenAFS on various platforms, or for other infrastructure needs. You may wish to
send the OpenAFS Foundation physical hardware, or you may consider simply allowing
OpenAFS developers to access a server that you host; either way, if you can spare any hardware resources, please [contact us]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact/).

### Donate Time and Energy ###

If you wish to volunteer, there are a multitude of options; surely, there will be something that suits your availability and inclination!

1. OpenAFS Documentation: To help improve the OpenAFS software itself or its documentation, take
a look around [openafs.org](http://www.openafs.org/). There, you can find
information about bug reporting, OpenAFS source code, documentation, or more
resources to find more information.

2. The OpenAFS Foundation's Web Site: If you want to help improve our web site, the site source
is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/adeason/openafsfoundation.org/). If
you already know how to use git and GitHub, just submit a pull request to make
changes. If you need help, feel free to [contact us]({{ site.baseurl}}/contact/).

3. Event Coordination: If you are interested in planning, organizing, and managing an OpenAFS conference, or you want to
volunteer at one of OpenAFS's existing conferences, please [contact
us]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact/). 

4. Sample Use Case Descriptions: If you have had a positive experience with OpenAFS, we want you to
submit your [success story]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact/) to tell others about your
experience. Several members of the OpenAFS community also give talks about
OpenAFS at other technology conferences from time to time, simply talking about
what OpenAFS is and how it has helped them. Raising awareness of OpenAFS and
showing how it has helped you is an extremely helpful contribution to OpenAFS.

5. OpenAFS Work Groups: If you feel moved to contribute in an existing work group, or wish to start a new one, your enthusiasm and contribution is much appreciated.  Please get in touch with us and [contact us]({{ site.baseurl}}/contact/).

6. New Ideas or Initiatives: If innovation and boot-strapping up something is among your gifts, you can pitch in by proposing something utterly new and different.  Please [let us hear]({{ site.baseurl}}/contact/) about it in detail.
