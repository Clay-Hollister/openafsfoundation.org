## Support OpenAFS ##

If you wish to see OpenAFS grow and improve, there are a variety of ways you
can contribute resources to OpenAFS Foundation, which will use those resources
to improve or promote OpenAFS. However, note that the OpenAFS Foundation is
currently **not** a 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation, and donations to the
OpenAFS Foundation are **not** tax deductible. (See our [about
page]({{site.baseurl}}/about/) for more information about The Foundation's
legal status.)

### Equipment ###

OpenAFS sometimes can make use of donated machines to be used for building
OpenAFS on various platforms, or other infrastructure needs. If you wish to
send the OpenAFS Foundation physical hardware, or if you wish to just allow
OpenAFS developers to access a server that you host, please [contact
us]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact/).

### Volunteer ###

If you wish to donate your time and skills to OpenAFS, there are several
options. To help improve the OpenAFS software itself or its documentation, take
a look around [openafs.org](http://www.openafs.org/). There, you can find
information about bug reporting, OpenAFS source code, documentation, or more
resources to find more information.

If you want to help improve The OpenAFS Foundation's web site, the site source
is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/adeason/openafsfoundation.org/). If
you already know how to use git and GitHub, just submit a pull request to make
changes. If you need help, just [contact us]({{ site.baseurl}}/contact/).

If you are interested in organizing an OpenAFS conference, or you want to
volunteer at one of OpenAFS's existing conferences, please [contact
us]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact/). 

If you have had a positive experience with OpenAFS, it can also be helpful to
submit a [success story]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact/) to tell others about your
experience. Several members of the OpenAFS community also give talks about
OpenAFS at other technology conferences from time to time, simply talking about
what OpenAFS is and how it has helped them. Raising awareness of OpenAFS and
showing how it has helped you is an extremely helpful contribution to OpenAFS.
