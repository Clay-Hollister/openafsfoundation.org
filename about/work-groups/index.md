## Foundation Work Groups ##

This page has been reserved for Work Groups, functioning under the Foundation's umbrella, to introduce themselves, their purpose(s), and their leader(s).  For example, a Conference Work Group might form, with its own and authorized group leader, that is tasked with "putting on" a specific event such as a Best Practices Workshop on a specific date.

At present, no Work Groups have formed and are actively working.
