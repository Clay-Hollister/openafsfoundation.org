### Attendees ###

* Dave Botsch
* Todd Desantis
* Margarete Ziemer

### Discussion ###

Dave is working with Kyle Floberg of Durham and Bates on insurance
* Looking at $1M E&O and $1M General Liability
* Includes Business Personal Property
  + Agreement among the Board that we don't need the BPP
  + Have asked if can have removed or is mandatory
* Base does not include Intellectual Property
  + Board agreeed that we want IPP
  + Asked for the additional MTK-227 endorsement for Intellectual Property
  + Noted that there are limitations of what this includes (eg includes copyright infringement but not patent infrigement)
* Insurance covers employees and volunteers working on behalf of or for the Foundation
* Potential problem: definition of "services" says "for a fee"
  + Have asked for clarfication (eg fee of zero, or does "free" mean not covered)
  + A little surprising considering there was early awareness that we are FOSS, and that clarifying question was asked prior to the quote
* Looking at a premium of around $1K/year

Potential Workshop
* Margarete feels that if there is to be one next fall, a "save the date" needs to go out before calendar year end
* Margarete stated has heard a lot of questions to the tune of will there be another workshop
* Went back over response from previous contact with the workshop committee
  + Response was mostly positive and did a good job of talking about the successes and challenges of holding a workshop
  + Seems there is interest from the committee in holding another workshop if there is enough interest and enough sponsors and talks
  + Door is open for the Foundation to participate somehow
* If participating, Foundation should be more cognizant of its role and be more prepared than previously

Todd working with his manager on obtaining old developer documenation, notes, etc.
* Things are slowly moving along... had to get a file server set up, had to get access, etc etc

Thanks to Todd for taking care of renewing the domain registration. 1&1's website is a challenge.

Taxes filed

Tax documents
* We have the documents and financial statements, tho not ready for posting
* Don't want to post folks' personal addresses (though publicly available, eg phonebook, we're not going to just put those up)
  + First attempt at blacking out addresses didn't work
* Not much in the financials other than a little income, a few payments to the lawyer, the domain registration, and the one sponsorship of a previous workshop attendee
* Documents are available should we be audited or have to respond to a legal matter.

Funding priorities
* Ben - he rocks
* Windows client
  + Urgent considering changes MS is making. Would be nice if their documentation was consistent or even easy to find on what's what.
* Mac client
  + Does the new filesystem break stuff? Probably. At least SNM is working on the Mac client.

Will hit fundraising as soon as insurance comes through.
* If every org gives just $1K, much more than the value they get out of OpenAFS, would make a huge difference. Hopefully, some orgs would give more, or even donate code.
