### Attendees ###

* Dave Botsch
* Todd Desantis

### Discussion ###

* Re-opened insurance quote requests with Nonprofit Insurance Alliance Group from February
* Tax time!
* Website back up - 1and1 "fixed" things for us.
* Working on finding old developer documentation/notes/etc
* Opened discussion with Workshop working group on holding a 2018 workshop. Should be in summer... might have ins at a university (though bad experiences previously with univ hosting), is costly to hold. Previously, attendance was low. What do sponsors get/expect at what sponsorship levels?
* Reached out to Ben K to thank him for all his hard work on OpenAFS -- he's been a one man show keeping OpenAFS going.
