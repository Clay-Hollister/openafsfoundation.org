### Discussion ###

#### Mac OS X Packaging ####

* Foundation does not yet have a signing key or liability insurance
* But, would like to get something out the door prior to XMas
* Pre-release of packaging
* Work with Evan MacBeth and Brandon Allbery on what to submit, initially, and how
* Initial pre-release may simply be binary signed by Sine Nomine

#### Gatekeepers / Release Managers ####

* Discussion with Michale Meffie to bring the Board up to speed on what's what and who is who
* Also talked online separately with Ben Kaduk to glean some information
* Board wants to make sure we have people doing what needs to be done.
  * Board would also like to make these official voted on positions, eventually going the paid position route
  * Skill level is important
  * Familiarity and a deep understanding of OpenAFS (code base) is important
  * Hours can range depending on progress
  * Including a technical leadership position
* Gerrit was set up and administrated by SxW
  * Don't know who administrates Gerrit currently
  * Ben K can restart gerrit if it dies
  * Merging code requires a password key
* Current Gatekeepers (those with merge access, not necessarily those who still consider themselves Gatekeepers)
  * Have the final say on what goes in
  * Need familiarity with OpenAFS code
  * Master
    * Andrew Deason
    * Ben Kaduk (targeting an eventual 1.8 branch)
    * Daria Brashear
    * Jeffrey Altman
  * 1.6 Branch (Release Managers - those who can merge a specific branch)
    * Andrew Deason
    * Paul Smeddle
    * Stephen Wiesand
* Status of branches
  * 1.6 is mostly fine (though, no one specifically looking at Mac)
  * Master needs more people
  * Windows is its own kettle of fish
* Code submission process
  * Code submitted to Gerrit
  * Code reviewed by at least 2 people (may include Gatekeeper/Release Manager)
  * After approval by 2, Gatekeeper/Release Manager merges code, if decided that this is what goes in
  
### Future TODO ###

* Security officers
* Questions for the lawyer
* Get out a plan for specific funding goals
* Mac Packaging
