## OpenAFS Foundation Meeting Notes  2015-10-02 ##

### In Attendance ###

 Dave Botsch,
 Todd DeSantis,
 Margarete Ziemer

### Topics ###

* Discussion of candidates for Foundation membership

Margarete's general thoughts:

Board as fundraisers, "face", "politicians", "evangelists", and public representatives
  * Technical Advisor Group
    * AFS superstars and/or users will focus on AFS technology concerned
      * standardization
      * new feature development
      * writing RFPs
      * selecting winning bidders on a given project
    * "save" for this group, best fit/etc:
      * Ben Kaduk - Commiteter/Gatekeeper
      * Andrew Deason - Committer/Gatekeeper (no longer w Sine Nomine as of Sep 1)
      * Mike Meffie - Standardization
      * Jeff Hutzelman - Standardization
      * Mark Vitale - Security (game changer/area of grave concern at BpW)
      * Phil Moorer - info source and "coach" for the Board's corporate reachout
      * Thoms Keiser - unknown if he wants to remain active

One of the major problems, IMHO, with "reserving" these people is that
one or more of them may actually make gread candidates for the Board.
And, with our resources being limtied, I'm not sure we can afford to
really "reserve" someone.

During one of our previous calls, we had decided and voted to approach
Ben if we didn't get any other self nominations, which we have not. I
think Ben could be a great candidate in that he's great at interfacing
with people.

It would certainly be good, also, to get Phil's advice/training/coaching
etc on Corporate Reachout, regardless of his current involvement with
AFS. We also still need to finalize things w. our Corporate Sponsorhip
discussions, there.

Finally, Jeff Hutzelman is rotating away from his current position in
the standardization committee. I don't recall anyone else stepping up
there (several declined, as a matter of fact). Though, Jeff still may be
knowledgeable/etc.
