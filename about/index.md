       Workshops, free-of-charge ad-hoc consulting/training via the OpenAFS
       ticketing system, etc.)
    3. Aid, assist, and support other persons and organizations of any kind
       who wish to learn and/or employ OpenAFS &mdash; by gifts, grants,
       contributions or otherwise &mdash; provided that such activities are
       constant with the foregoing purpose

### Who We Are ###

The OpenAFS Foundation, Inc., is guided by our
[Board of Directors]({{ site.baseurl }}/board/), a diverse group of richly
experienced individuals who agreed to volunteer for this leadership challenge.
The Board of Directors has an Executive Director as its head, and is supported
by volunteers who accepted the roles of Treasurer or Secretary. The Board of
Directors oversees, and has final authority over, all activities within The
OpenAFS Foundation, Inc.

Among the OpenAFS Foundation's central values are fairness and transparency.
We believe that not only the lines of authority and the various tasks should be
disclosed, but also the financial status of the OpenAFS Foundation. All moneys
were donated to The Foundation and its causes by individuals or organizations
wishing to support both our mission and our vision. Thus, information about
our financials is always available [here]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/finances/). In
addition, the [Code of Ethics](XXXbrokenlink), the [Conflict of Interest
Policy](XXXbrokenlink), the [Whistleblower Protection Policy](XXXbrokenlink)

### Legal Status ###

The OpenAFS Foundation, Inc. currently exists as a for-profit corporation
incorporated in the State of Pennsylvania, but is actively pursuing non-profit
status. The Foundation's Entity Number is 4189117, assigned by the Pennsylvania
Department of State's Bureau of Corporations and Charitable Organizations on

While The Foundation was incorporated with the intent of being awarded a
non-profit tax status by the IRS, any corporation like ours will start with a
for-profit tax status until the IRS has indeed granted a non-profit status.
This means that, until and unless awarded a non-profit status by the IRS,
corporate tax returns must be filed as for-profit entity. Our tax returns are
publicly available, and can be viewed [here]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/finances/).

The OpenAFS Foundation also makes use of the common law trademarks "AFS" and
"OpenAFS" that are owned by IBM. IBM granted the right to use these trademarks
to the five people that comprised The Foundation's Creation Committee on May
10, 2013, and these rights were transferred to The OpenAFS Foundation, Inc.
when it was incorporated. The full agreement can be found on [our documents
page]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/).
