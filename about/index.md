## About The Foundation ##

The OpenAFS Foundation, Inc., was incorporated in the State of Pennsylvania on
May 20 of 2013, as a corporation with the intent of becoming a non-profit
organization.

### What We Do ###

The OpenAFS Foundation adopted a three-fold mission:

1. To attract and increase the community of OpenAFS users
2. To foster the OpenAFS community of experts
3. To nurture and evolve the OpenAFS technology.

We expect our activities for accomplishing our mission to be diverse, but our
vision includes that the OpenAFS Foundation facilitate the following:

1.  In order to attract and increase the community of OpenAFS users, The
    Foundation plans to:

    1. Offer OpenAFS and associated technologies to all members of the general
       public, individuals and organizations alike, through the use of open
       source licensing, free of charge
    2. Educate members of the general public in the application of OpenAFS and
       associated technologies (Hackathons and/or paid internships such as
       "Google Summer of Code," low-cost conferences, low-cost Best Practices
       Workshops, free-of-charge ad-hoc consulting/training via the OpenAFS
       ticketing system, etc.)
    3. Aid, assist, and support other persons and organizations of any kind
       who wish to learn and/or employ OpenAFS &mdash; by gifts, grants,
       contributions or otherwise &mdash; provided that such activities are
       constant with the foregoing purpose
    4. Seek contributions by persons and organizations of any kind, via gifts,
       grants, contributions, "in kind" or other donation

2.  In order to foster the OpenAFS community of experts, The Foundation intends
    to:

    1. Seek contributions in both skills and talent (mentoring, conference
       presentations, publications, etc.)
    2. Educate member of the OpenAFS community of experts (Hackathons and/or
       paid internships such as "Google Summer of Code," low-cost conferences,
       low-cost Best Practices Practices Workshops, free-of-charge ad-hoc
       consulting/training via the OpenAFS ticketing system which records and
       archives any technical issues and/or questions posted along with their
       answers, etc.)
    3. Model and foster a spirit of cooperation and professionalism
       (mentoring, free-of-charge mailing list contributions, free-of-charge
       ad-hoc consulting/training via the OpenAFS ticketing system, etc).

3.  In order to nurture and evolve the OpenAFS technology, The Foundation plans
    to:

    1. Strengthen OpenAFS, as defined as intellectual property such as
       interfaces, tools, and libraries
    2. Advance OpenAFS and associated technologies through scientific research
       and development
    3. Support and participate in protocol standardization

### Who We Are ###

The OpenAFS Foundation, Inc., is guided by our
[Board of Directors]({{ site.baseurl }}/board/), a diverse group of richly
experienced individuals who agreed to volunteer for this leadership challenge.
The Board of Directors has an Executive Director as its head, and is supported
by volunteers who accepted the roles of Treasurer or Secretary. The Board of
Directors oversees, and has final authority over, all activities within The
OpenAFS Foundation, Inc.

Under the umbrella of The Foundation's leadership, a variety of work groups will be set up.  Some of these groups will have ongoing tasks (e.g., a AFS Standardization Work Group), while others will serve on a temporary basis (e.g., a group organizing a specific Best Practices Workshop).  The Foundation welcomes proposals for work groups emerging out of the community; each proposal should be submitted in writing to the Secretary of the Board of Directors, who in turn will present it to the Board of Directors, and should indicate the suggested leader(s), goal(s), map for achieving those goals, timelines, and other information that might aid the Board of Directors in casting an affirmative vote on the acceptance of the proposed work group. 

Among the OpenAFS Foundation's central values are fairness and transparency.
We believe that not only the lines of authority and the various tasks should be
disclosed, but also the financial status of the OpenAFS Foundation. All moneys
were donated to The Foundation and its causes by individuals or organizations
wishing to support both our mission and our vision. Thus, information about
our financials is always available [here]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/finances/). In
addition, the [Code of Ethics](XXXbrokenlink), the [Conflict of Interest
Policy](XXXbrokenlink), the [Whistleblower Protection Policy](XXXbrokenlink)
will aid you in understanding other core values of the OpenAFS Foundation. 

### Legal Status ###

The OpenAFS Foundation, Inc. currently exists as a for-profit corporation
incorporated in the State of Pennsylvania, but is actively pursuing non-profit
status. The Foundation's Entity Number is 4189117, assigned by the Pennsylvania
Department of State's Bureau of Corporations and Charitable Organizations on
May 20, 2013. The Foundation's federal Employer Identification Number (EIN) is
46-2902947, assigned by the IRS on June 4, 2013. Official documents and forms
defining The Foundation are available on [our documents
page]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/}}).

While The Foundation was incorporated in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as a non-profit corporation, we aim at achieving a non-profit status on the national level and, to that effect, request said national status with the IRS.  During this national non-profit application process with the IRS, The Foundation will be a non-profit corporation on the State level while being viewed as a for-profit-corporation-with-the-intent-to-become-a-non-profit-corporation on the Federal level.
This means that, until and unless awarded a Federal non-profit status by the IRS,
Federal corporate tax returns must be filed as for-profit entity. Our tax returns are
publicly available, and can be viewed [here]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/finances/).

The OpenAFS Foundation also makes use of the common law trademarks "AFS" and
"OpenAFS" that are owned by IBM. IBM granted the right to use these trademarks
to the five people that comprised The Foundation's Creation Committee on May
10, 2013, and these rights were transferred to The OpenAFS Foundation, Inc.
when it was incorporated. The full agreement can be found on [our documents
page]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/).
