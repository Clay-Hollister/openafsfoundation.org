## How we foster the OpenAFS user community ##

A wide variety of activities aim at fostering the OpenAFS user community.

Special events and learning opportunities are being offered from time to time, and anybody is invited to participate.  Specific AFS user initiatives may be called into being and supported.  Particular user groups can be formed based on user needs and interests.  All users, new or seasoned alike, can take the initiative to either list and describe, or help resolve, current known major projects and challenges.  Of central importance and unparalleled value is the OpenAFS mailing list, where anybody can submit questions and receive answers from their peers in (almost) real time; this mailing list records and archives such questions and answers in an instance of the Report Tracker ("RT) dedicated to OpenAFS.

Last but not least, we urge you to review our in-search-of ("ISO") list that shows and describes specific roles or tasks for which volunteers are sought in order to foster the user community -- including you!.  Please discern how you can contribute to this community, and generously help.  Thank you.
