## OpenAFS Use Cases, Success Stories, Testimonials ##

It goes without saying that we believe OpenAFS to be valuable technology.  Yet without user adoption, what we think is of little import.  

Specific [use cases]({http://openafs.org/success}) for OpenAFS may shed light on how this technology has been employed in real life.  A collection of [success stories]({http://openafs.org}/success) should not only reflect our pride in OpenAFS but also tell you about situations when OpenAFS technology "saved the day:"

  - Stanford Linear Accelerator (research)

  - ParallelDatorCentrum, Center for Parallel Computers at KTH (research)
  
  - Pictage, Inc. (business)
 
  - NCSA at UIUC (educational institution)

  - United States Geological Survey (government)

  - Duke University (educational institution)
  

Last but not least, in our [user testimonials]({http://openafs.org}/success), you can read verbatim what experienced OpenAFS users think.

The application of OpenAFS has proven useful in a variety of settings: educational institutions, research institutions, small companies, world-wide corporations, and more.
