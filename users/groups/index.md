## OpenAFS User Groups ##

We need to hear from you!

Are OpenAFS User Groups desirable, and do some already exist?  Are the formed in a special region, and if so, where?  Are they formed in a specific industry sector, or within the educational realm, and if so, which?  What do these user groups accomplish? What do the users find helpful, and/or what would they like to see established to help them?

What might be some challenges for user groups?  Can you think of ways to mitigate them or prevent them altogether?

At present, we are not aware of any active OpenAFS User Groups.  Please help create them!
