    year or until the election and qualification of their successors.  Each
    member of the Board of Directors then in office shall elect successor
    Directors to serve should such member resign.  Such power of appointment

    vote of the Board of Directors as set forth under section 8 of this Article
    shall govern.
 
    Vacant directorships may be filled as set forth under section 8 of this
    Article.

4.  Quorum of Directors and Action by the Board

    A majority of the entire Board of Directors shall constitute a quorum for
    the transaction of business, and, except where otherwise provided herein,
    the vote of a majority of the Directors present at a meeting at the time of
    such vote, if a quorum is then present, shall be the act of the Board.
 
    Any action required or permitted to be taken by the Board of Directors or
    any committee thereof may be taken without a meeting if all members of the
    Board or the committee consent in writing to the adoption of a resolution
    authorizing the action.  The resolution and the written consent thereto by
    the members of the Board or committee shall be filed with the minutes of
    the proceedings of the Board or committee.
 
5.  Meetings of the Board
 
    Regular meetings of the Board of Directors shall be held at such times as
    may be fixed by the Board, on an annual or more frequent basis.  Special
    meetings of the Board may be held at any time upon the call of the
    Executive Director or any two Directors.
 
    Meetings of the Board of Directors shall be held at such places as may be
    fixed by the Board for regular meetings and in the notice of meeting for
    special meetings.  If no place is so fixed, meetings of the Board shall be
    held at the principal office of the Corporation.  Any one or more members
    of the Board of Directors may participate in meetings by means of a
    conference telephone or similar communications equipment.  
 
    No notice need be given of regular meetings of the Board of Directors.
    Notice of each special meeting of the Board shall be given to each Director
    either by mail not later than noon, Pennsylvania time, on the third day
    prior to the meeting or by telegram, written message or orally not later
    than noon, Pennsylvania time, on the day prior to the meeting.  Notices are
    deemed to have been properly given if given:  by mail, when deposited in
    the United States mail; by telegram at the time of filing; or by messenger
    at the time of delivery.  Notices by mail, telegram or messenger shall be
    sent to each Director at the address designated by him for that purpose,
    or, if none has been so designated, at his last known residence or business
    address.
 
    Notice of a meeting of the Board of Directors need not be given to any
    Director who submits a signed waiver of notice whether before or after the
    meeting, or who attends the meeting without protesting, prior thereto or at
    its commencement, the lack of notice to any Director.
 
    A notice, or waiver of notice, need not specify the purpose of any meeting
    of the Board of Directors.
     
    A majority of the Directors present, whether or not a quorum is present,
    may adjourn any meeting to another time and place.  Notice of any
    adjournment of a meeting to another time or place shall be given, in the
    manner described above, to the Directors who were not present at the time
    of the adjournment and, unless such time and place are announced at the
    meeting, to the other Directors.

6.  Resignations
 
    Any Director of the Corporation may resign at any time by giving written
    notice to the Board of Directors or to the Executive Director or to the
    Secretary of the Corporation.  Such resignation shall take effect at the
    time specified therein; and unless otherwise specified therein the
    acceptance of such resignation shall not be necessary to make it effective.
 
7.  Removal of Directors
 
    Any one or more of the Directors may be removed for cause by action of the
    Board of Directors.  
 
8.  Newly Created Directorships and Vacancies
 
    Newly created directorships resulting from an increase in the number of
    Directors and vacancies occurring in the Board of Directors for any reason
    may be filled by vote of a majority of the Directors then in office,
    although less than a quorum exists.  A Director elected to fill a vacancy
    shall be elected to hold office for the unexpired term of his predecessor.

    Directors may also elect one or more Vice Presidents, Assistant Secretaries
    and Assistant Treasurers.

    other duties as may be prescribed by the Board of Directors or Executive
    Director, under whose supervision the Secretary shall be.  The Secretary
    shall have custody of the corporate seal of the Corporation and the
