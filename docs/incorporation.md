    interests of the Corporation.  If the determination is to be made by the
    board of directors, it may rely, as to all questions of law, on the advice
    of independent counsel.  Such right of indemnification shall not be deemed

    Corporation is then located, exclusively for such purposes or to such
    organization or organizations, as said Court shall determine, which are
    organized and operated exclusively for such purposes.
