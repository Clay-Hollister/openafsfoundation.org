# First, we have directives that are processed by jekyll itself:

# Disable custom plugins (this is how "Github pages" runs)
safe: true

kramdown:
  # Disable "smart quotes"/"curly quotes"
  smart_quotes: ["apos", "apos", "quot", "quot"]

defaults:
  # For all pages, default to the 'page' layout
  - scope:
      type: "pages"
    values:
      layout: "page"

 # But for things in /ui (css, js, etc) default to no layout
  - scope:
      path: "ui"
    values:
      layout: ~
