## Help Support OpenAFS! ##

If you wish to see OpenAFS grow and improve, there are a variety of ways you
can contribute resources to OpenAFS Foundation, which will use those resources
to improve or promote OpenAFS. However, note that the OpenAFS Foundation is
currently **not** a 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation, and donations to the
OpenAFS Foundation are **not** tax deductible. (See our [ABOUT
page]({{site.github.url}}/about/) for more information about The Foundation's
legal status.)

There are various ways in which you can support OpenAFS:
  - donate money
  - donate "in kind": used equipment, etc.
  - donate time: volunteer
  - donate talent and skills: mentor others
  - contribute code
  - contribute documentation
  
Please consider how **you** can pitch in and help!  Thank you.
