## Help Us By Contributing Code And/Or Documentation ##

Obviously, your **contributions to the OpenAFS code** are critical for the survival and improvement of the OpenAFS technology.  If you are a developer who understands this technology and is passionate about extending it, your coding skills are desperately needed.

Code contributions can also be made in the form of **reviewing code** written by one of your peers.  Professional feedback is valuable and appreciated, and your review will help your colleague to further improve his/her produced code.

Should you feel your gift and expertise doesn't lie so much in writing new code or debugging code, but rather in **writing documentation** for already existing code, we will treasure your help.  Extensive areas of the OpenAFS code are in dire need of documentation, and if you wish to tackle a particular part of the code documentation, please let us know.

Another particular gift of yours might lie in the area of creating **code specifications** and/or **code design**.  Both are equally important for a coding project to be successful and effective, and both will be needed for submitting any **proposal** to the Technical Advisory Council which will evaluate it and help support your efforts.  

Whatever your skill level and area of interest: pitch in!  Thank you.
