## Business Contributors ##

We need to hear from you, please!

On this page, we would like to list, in alphabetical order, the names of those organizations that had their own employees, as development team(s), contribute code to OpenAFS.  The business funded these efforts by remunerating their employees for their work hours spent on improving OpenAFS.  This does not include work-for-hire, but contributions where the business contributors did not get any payments and donated their employee's talent temporarily.

We need to hear from you, business contributors, to thank you and to encourage other businesses to follow your example!  Please contact us and tell us about your contributions.  Thank you.

If you are not the business contributor yourself but know of a business that was and/or is, please take the initiative and tell us about it.  We need you to point us to those contributors. Thank you.
