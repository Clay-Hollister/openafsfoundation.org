## Business Contributors ##

Several businesses offer commercial support contracts for OpenAFS or will do custom OpenAFS development for hire, or both. As a service to the OpenAFS community, The Foundation maintains this list of organizations, in alphabetical order, that provide such services.

### Commercial Support Organizations ###

Sine Nomine Associates, Inc.
http://www.sinenomine.net/

Your File System, Inc.
https://www.your-file-system.com/

### Inclusion Criteria ###

Any organization that meets the following criteria may be included in this list at their request.

    The organization (company, individual, non-profit, etc.) provides either general OpenAFS support — installation services, bug analysis and fixes, administrative support, and so forth — or OpenAFS development for hire, or both.

    The organization has a past track record of releasing their work, where applicable, as open source and contributing it back to the OpenAFS community. Specifically, the organization has submitted at least five patches and/or bug reports to the project in the past year.

    The organization is open to new contracts and customers. 

Please note: This list is provided purely for informational purposes for the community. Inclusion in this list does not equal endorsement by the OpenAFS project. The list is strictly based on the criteria described below. For more information about any of these vendors, please contact the vendor directly. If you represent an organization that provides these services, meet the criteria listed below, and wish to be listed, please contact us. Thank you.

We need to hear from you, please!

On this page, we would like to list, in alphabetical order, the names of those organizations that had their own employees, as development team(s), contribute code to OpenAFS.  The business funded these efforts by remunerating their employees for their work hours spent on improving OpenAFS.  This does not include work-for-hire, but contributions where the business contributors did not get any payments and donated their employee's talent temporarily.

We need to hear from you, business contributors, to thank you and to encourage other businesses to follow your example!  Please contact us and tell us about your contributions.  Thank you.

If you are not the business contributor yourself but know of a business that was and/or is, please take the initiative and tell us about it.  We need you to point us to those contributors. Thank you.
