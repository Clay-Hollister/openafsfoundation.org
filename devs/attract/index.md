## How We Attract and Increase the OpenAFS Developer Community ##

A wide variety of activities take place with the goal of attracting and increasing the OpenAFS developer community.

Special events and learning opportunities are being offered from time to time, and any experienced OpenAFS user wishing to create or repair code is invited to participate. Specific AFS development initiatives may be called into being and supported. Particular developer groups can be formed based on user needs, and on developer talent and interests. All deveopers, new or seasoned alike, can take the initiative to either list and describe, or help resolve, current known major projects and challenges. Of central importance and unparalleled value are the OpenAFS-devel mailing list and the OpenAFS Jabber chat channel. Via the mailing lists, developers can discuss code improvements and changes in almost real time, while on the Jabber chat channel developers can discuss and suggest code changes and improvements with other developers in real time. Bugs may also be commented on and discussed via an instance of the Request Tracker ("RT) dedicated to OpenAFS; it is you who, as developer, needs to assist others and can breathe life into the future of OpenAFS and its installations.

Last but not least, we urge you to review our list of volunteer opportunities that shows and describes specific roles or tasks for which volunteers are sought with the aim of attracting and increasing the OpenAFS developer community -- including you!. Please discern how you can contribute to this community, and generously help. Thank you.
